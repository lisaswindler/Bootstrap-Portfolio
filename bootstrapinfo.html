        <p class="col-md-8 text-dark mb-4 pl-4 pr-2 pt-2">I'm the kind of person who likes to dabble in everything. I love home improvement, fixing things, sewing, making costumes, and any kind of design.
            I've written two young adult sci-fi/fantasy novels and plan to publish them soon. You can always get me talking about books, ideas, philosophy, and stories. I've always enjoyed learning languages and I have a degree 
            in linguistics.
       <br><br>
            I've been a stay-at-home mom for ten years while doing freelance projects on the side, such as web design, digital photo restoration, and cutting hair. 
            I just got a new job at a marketing company where I make sure our clients' websites and online ads are running smoothly.
            Doing this bootcamp is my way of getting a kickstart on my career so I can be a badass and make loads of money while still having time for family and friends because, 
            ultimately, I'm a firm believer that great relationships are the key to a great life.
